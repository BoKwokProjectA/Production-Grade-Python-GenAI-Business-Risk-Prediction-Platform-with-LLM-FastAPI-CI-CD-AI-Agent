## Overview

This project turns a risk detection research workflow into a deployed, production-style machine learning API, reflecting how modern businesses use risk prediction systems.

Users can upload an image through a FastAPI backend and receive a risk prediction from a two-model vision ensemble using ConvNeXt and EVA-02. The API is containerized with Docker, deployed on Google Cloud Run, and includes interactive Swagger documentation, checks, structured logging, clean backend architecture, and a retrieval-based RAG assistant for project/codebase Q&A.

This repository is presented as a job-application portfolio project for machine learning engineering, AI engineering, automation engineering, backend engineering, and MLOps-oriented roles. It demonstrates the ability to move from notebook experimentation to a deployed API, design production-style software architecture, package an ML system with Docker, connect the backend to a working Power Platform/Copilot Studio workflow, deploy to cloud infrastructure, and document safety and governance decisions clearly.

The goal of this project is not only to build a model inference endpoint, but to demonstrate how machine learning research code can be transformed into a real backend system that is easier to deploy, document, monitor, and extend.

## Key Features

### Core ML Capabilities

**Two-Model Vision Ensemble:** Uses `convnext_small` and `eva02_small_patch14_336` through PyTorch + Timm for deployed image inference.

**Model-Specific Image Transforms:** Uses model-specific resize/crop pipelines such as 384px preprocessing for ConvNeXt and 336px preprocessing for EVA-02.

**Lazy Model Loading:** Models are loaded once and reused for inference through a `models_loaded` flag.

**Device-Aware Inference:** Automatically selects CUDA when available and CPU otherwise.

**Mean Ensemble Prediction:** Combines model probabilities through simple ensemble averaging.

**Real Image Upload Inference Endpoint:** Upload a dermoscopy image and receive a malignant/benign lesion risk prediction.

**Probability-Based Classification:** Converts malignant probability into benign/malignant prediction labels using the backend prediction flow.

### Prediction Logic

The API performs inference using a two-model ensemble: **ConvNeXt Small + EVA-02 Small**.

1. Each model processes the uploaded dermoscopy image independently.
2. Both models output a probability score for the malignant class after softmax.
3. The final probability is the average of the two model outputs.
4. Classification rule:
   - Probability `< 0.5` → classified as `benign`
   - Probability `>= 0.5` → classified as `malignant`

This ensemble approach provides a good balance between accuracy and inference speed while keeping the deployment lightweight.

### Production Backend

**FastAPI with Clean Architecture:** Layered structure using API routes, services, repositories, schemas, models, inference, RAG, and core configuration.

**Async Image Processing:** Handles image uploads with validation before inference.

**Pydantic v2 Schemas:** Strong type validation and automatic OpenAPI documentation.

**Structured Logging:** Application logging using `structlog` JSON rendering.

**Application Lifespan Hooks:** Logs startup and shutdown events through FastAPI lifespan management.

**CORS Middleware:** Enables cross-origin usage for web clients, demos, and frontend integration.

**Image Upload Validation:** Rejects non-image uploads with a meaningful `400` response.

**Typed Prediction Response:** Returns `isic_id`, `probability`, `prediction`, `model_version`, and `timestamp`.

**Config Caching:** Uses `@lru_cache()` for efficient settings loading.

**Environment Configuration:** Uses `.env` with fields such as `APP_NAME`, `API_VERSION`, `MODEL_VERSION`, `DEBUG`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `SECRET_KEY`.

**Copilot Support Schemas:** CopilotSupportRequest validates question, conversation_id, and user_role; CopilotSupportResponse returns answer, intent, risk_level, automation_allowed, escalation_required, sources, and safety_note.

**Support Service Intent Routing:** Copilot Support Service classifies support requests into technical intent categories such as `api_support`, `image_upload_support`, `failed_upload_support`, `prediction_explanation`, `governance`, `general_platform_support`, and `medical_advice`. Medical-advice intent is treated as prohibited and redirected to a qualified clinician rather than answered directly through Microsoft Power Automate.

### Intelligent RAG Assistant

**Project-Aware Retrieval Assistant:** Retrieves relevant project source-code context for technical Q&A.

**Vector Search:** Uses FAISS with Sentence Transformers embeddings.

**Codebase Indexing:** Indexes Python files from `src/**/*.py` plus a short project summary.

**Chat Endpoint:** `/api/v1/chat` accepts a question and returns retrieved project context.

### Microsoft Copilot Studio AI Agent, Demo Website Integration, Power Platform Connector, and Safety Behaviour

The Copilot Studio notebook creates a technical-support-only support agent for the Skin Lesion Platform. The agent can explain API usage, image upload steps, probability scores, failed uploads, governance, and medical safety boundaries. It must not diagnose, classify, or interpret a user's lesion.

The Copilot Studio agent is also activated in the live demo website as an embedded technical-support chat experience. The agent is scoped to project and platform support only. It can explain API usage, image upload requirements, prediction response fields, failed upload troubleshooting, workflow behaviour, governance documents, and safety limitations.

The agent does not provide medical diagnosis, lesion interpretation, treatment advice, or clinical decision-making. Medical questions are refused with a safety-focused redirect to a qualified clinician.

**SharePoint Knowledge Source:** The Copilot Studio support agent uses a Microsoft SharePoint document library as its knowledge source. Project support and governance documents were converted into PDF format and uploaded to SharePoint so the agent can ground answers in maintained documentation about API usage, image uploads, probability scores, failed-upload troubleshooting, action tiers, human-in-the-loop review, security architecture, and medical safety boundaries.

The SharePoint knowledge source is used only for technical and operational platform support. It is not used to provide medical diagnosis, treatment advice, or lesion interpretation.

The updated project notebooks introduce a technical AI agent, Power Automate workflow integration, and supporting artefacts for safer AI-assistant development. These are included as portfolio evidence of responsible AI engineering and practical automation integration.
**AI Agent:** Provides technical support around the platform, API behaviour, upload flow, prediction response format, governance process, and safety limitations.
**Power Automate Integration:** Connects a working Power Automate workflow to the Dockerized FastAPI backend, showing how the deployed API can be used inside a low-code automation flow.
**Prompt Versioning:** Includes system prompt versions, safety-focused prompt updates, a prompt changelog, and a review checklist.

**Safety-Focused Assistant Rules:** Defines boundaries for technical support, including refusing medical diagnosis, treatment advice, or image interpretation requests.

**Evaluation Suite:** Includes golden cases for expected technical answers, hallucination checks, regression-style tests, and safety tests.

**Governance Documentation:** Includes an action tier model, medical AI safety policy, human-in-the-loop policy, security architecture notes, edge case register, and classification canon.

**Medical safety rule:** if the user asks for diagnosis, treatment, or lesion interpretation, the agent refuses and redirects the user to a qualified clinician while still offering technical platform information.

These artefacts show how the project combines safer assistant behaviour, evaluation gates, governance practices, and a working automation workflow without presenting the system as a medical decision-making tool.

### Production & Observability

**SQLite-Ready Persistence Layer:** SQLAlchemy model and repository structure are prepared for future prediction history storage.

**Repository Pattern:** Encapsulates future database write logic in `PredictionRepository`.

**Error Handling:** Includes validation and meaningful API errors for unsupported uploads and service-level failures.

**Health Check Support:** Health endpoint is available for deployment checks and uptime monitoring.

**Docker Support:** Fully containerized for cloud deployment.

**Google Cloud Run Deployment:** Deployed with Docker on Google Cloud Run.

**Google Cloud Build Source Deployment:** Uses `gcloud run deploy --source .` deployment workflow.

**Warm Instance Setup:** Cloud Run configured with `--min-instances 1` for live demo readiness and reduced cold-start impact.

**JSON Structured Logs:** `structlog` is configured with JSON rendering for production log aggregation.

**Startup/Shutdown Logging:** Application lifecycle events are recorded for easier debugging.

### Developer Experience

**Modular Codebase:** Separated API, service, inference, RAG, schema, config, and repository layers.

**Notebook-to-Production Workflow:** Refactored setup, inference, backend, RAG, ensemble, and deployment work from notebooks into a deployable project.

**Deployment Ready:** Containerized for Docker and Google Cloud Run.

**Full ML Application Lifecycle:** Documents how the work moves from notebook experimentation into a deployed API with clear review points across model inference, backend architecture, deployment, automation integration, monitoring readiness, and safety.

## Docker

The project is containerized with Docker and deployed successfully on Google Cloud Run. The Dockerfile runs the FastAPI app on port `8080`.

Reference Docker commands:

```bash
docker build -t isic-flagship .
docker run -p 8000:8080 isic-flagship
```

Container startup command:

```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8080}
```

Requirements include FastAPI 0.115.2, Uvicorn 0.32.0, Pydantic 2.9.2, SQLAlchemy 2.0.35, pandas 2.2.2, numpy 1.26.4, pillow 10.4.0, timm 1.0.11, LightGBM 4.5.0, CatBoost 1.2.7, XGBoost 2.1.1, scikit-learn 1.5.2, LangChain 0.3.4, FAISS CPU 1.8.0.post1, Sentence Transformers 3.1.1, python-multipart 0.0.9, httpx 0.27.2, and structlog 24.4.0.

For Google Cloud Run, the container uses the platform-provided `PORT` environment variable. The deployment can be kept warm with `--min-instances 1` for live demo readiness.



## Power Automate Workflow and Copilot Studio Integration

The project includes a Power Platform custom connector and Copilot Studio technical support-agent integration connected to the Dockerized FastAPI backend. The backend also accepts a POWER_AUTOMATE_URL secret, so a Power Automate webhook can be configured safely through Google Secret Manager.

The Copilot Studio agent is also connected to a SharePoint knowledge source containing PDF versions of the project support and governance documents. This gives the agent a maintained document source for technical support answers while keeping the medical safety boundary explicit.

The automation layer is presented as practical AI workflow automation around the backend. It does not automate medical diagnosis, treatment advice, or clinical decision-making.

**Copilot Studio setup:** create an agent named Skin Lesion Platform AI Agent, describe it as technical support only, add the knowledge source, import the custom connector, add the support action, add the six support topics, run the manual tests, and publish only after safety checks pass.

The Copilot Studio agent has been activated in the live demo website, allowing users to interact with the support agent through an embedded web chat interface. This demonstrates a working end-user AI support layer on top of the deployed FastAPI backend and Power Platform integration.

## Google Cloud Run Deployment

The API is deployed on Google Cloud Run using Docker and Google Cloud Build source deployment.

**Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Run  
**Build System:** Google Cloud Build via `gcloud run deploy --source .`  
**Runtime Port:** `8080`  
**Warm Instance Setup:** `--min-instances 1` for live demo readiness  
**Public Access:** `--allow-unauthenticated`  
**API Docs:** Available through FastAPI Swagger UI at `/docs`

Example deployment command from the notebook workflow:

```bash
gcloud run deploy isic-api \
  --source . \
  --region europe-west2 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 4Gi \
  --cpu 1 \
  --min-instances 1 \
  --max-instances 3 \
  --timeout 300 \
  --port 8080 \
  --cpu-boost \
  --set-secrets POWER_AUTOMATE_URL=power-automate-url:latest \
  --project isic-flagship-project
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This repository includes a basic portfolio-grade CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

The CI workflow runs on push and pull request events. It installs dependencies, runs Ruff linting, checks Black formatting, and executes pytest tests using dummy environment variables so CI does not call real OpenAI APIs, Power Automate webhooks, or production secrets.

The Docker workflow builds the FastAPI Docker image, starts the container inside GitHub Actions, and smoke-tests the `/api/v1/health` endpoint to confirm the container can run successfully.

The deployment workflow deploys automatically to Google Cloud Run after the Docker smoke test succeeds on `main`. It uses Cloud Run source deployment:

```bash
gcloud run deploy isic-api --source .
```

This means the GitHub Actions workflow does not explicitly build, tag, or publish a Docker image to Artifact Registry. Google Cloud Build builds the service from source for Cloud Run.

For cost control, the automated deployment is configured with `--min-instances 0` and `--max-instances 1`. The workflow finishes with a live post-deployment health check against `/api/v1/health`.

CI test coverage includes:

* FastAPI app import test
* `/api/v1/health` endpoint test
* Invalid image upload rejection test
* Basic RAG assistant endpoint test
* Copilot/support-agent medical safety refusal test

This CI/CD setup supports a valid portfolio claim of automated testing, Docker smoke testing, and Cloud Run deployment for a FastAPI AI inference API. The project remains a portfolio AI engineering demo and is not a clinical diagnostic product, not a medical device, and not intended for diagnosis, treatment, or clinical decision-making.


## Environment Variables

Example `.env` / `.env.example`:

```env
APP_NAME=ISIC2024-Flagship
API_VERSION=v1
MODEL_VERSION=2024-ensemble-2models

DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./isic.db
SECRET_KEY=change-this-in-google-cloud-run
POWER_AUTOMATE_URL=your-power-automate-webhook-url
```

## Copilot Studio Knowledge Sources and Topics

The Copilot Studio notebook creates these six topic files under copilot_studio/topics/: upload_image.md, prediction_endpoint.md, probability.md, failed_upload.md, governance.md, and medical_safety.md.

Required/target knowledge documents include README.md, prompts/v1_system_prompt.md, prompts/v2_safety_prompt.md, prompts/prompt_changelog.md, governance/action_tier_model.md, governance/classification_canon.md, governance/human_in_the_loop_policy.md, governance/medical_ai_safety_policy.md, and governance/security_architecture.md.

The knowledge pack packaging process copies README, Copilot Studio setup/topic files, prompt files, and governance files into `copilot_studio/sharepoint_knowledge_pack/`. These documents are then converted or exported into PDF format where needed and uploaded to a SharePoint document library for use as Copilot Studio knowledge sources.

The SharePoint knowledge documents include platform-support material for:

- Prediction endpoint usage
- Image upload steps and failed-upload troubleshooting
- Probability score explanation
- Governance and action tiers
- Human-in-the-loop review policy
- Medical AI safety policy
- Security architecture
- Prompt versioning and safety rules

## Evaluation and Safety Artefacts

The updated notebook workflow includes evaluation and governance files that support responsible AI development:

```text
prompts/
├── v1_system_prompt.md
├── v2_safety_prompt.md
├── prompt_changelog.md
└── prompt_review_checklist.md

agent_evaluation/
├── golden_cases.json
├── hallucination_tests.json

```

These files demonstrate that the project considers:

- Medical AI safety boundaries
- Technical-support-only assistant behaviour
- Refusal behaviour for diagnosis or treatment questions
- Golden-case testing for expected answers
- Hallucination and safety testing
- Prompt review and changelog discipline
- Governance documentation suitable for professional AI workflows
- Power Automate workflow integration is presented as a working automation layer connected to the Dockerized backend. The AI agent remains scoped to technical support and safety-aware platform guidance, not medical diagnosis or treatment advice.
