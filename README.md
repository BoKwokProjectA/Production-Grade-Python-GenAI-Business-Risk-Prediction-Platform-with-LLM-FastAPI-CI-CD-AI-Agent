# ISIC 2024 Skin Cancer Detection - Flagship Portfolio Project

## ISIC 2024-Inspired Skin Lesion Prediction API + FastAPI + RAG Assistant + Docker + Google Cloud Run

---

## Overview

This project turns an ISIC 2024 skin cancer detection research workflow into a deployed, production-style machine learning API.

Users can upload a skin lesion image through a FastAPI backend and receive a malignant/benign risk prediction from a two-model vision ensemble using ConvNeXt and EVA-02. The API is containerized with Docker, deployed on Google Cloud Run, and includes interactive Swagger documentation, health checks, structured logging, clean backend architecture, and a retrieval-based RAG assistant for project/codebase Q&A.

The goal of this project is not only to build a model inference endpoint, but to demonstrate how machine learning research code can be transformed into a real backend system that is easier to deploy, document, monitor, and extend.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core ML Capabilities

- **Two-Model Vision Ensemble**: Uses `convnext_small` and `eva02_small_patch14_336` through PyTorch + Timm for deployed image inference.
- **Model-Specific Image Transforms**: Uses model-specific resize/crop pipelines such as 384px preprocessing for ConvNeXt and 336px preprocessing for EVA-02.
- **Lazy Model Loading**: Models are loaded once and reused for inference through a `models_loaded` flag.
- **Device-Aware Inference**: Automatically selects CUDA when available and CPU otherwise.
- **Mean Ensemble Prediction**: Combines model probabilities through simple ensemble averaging.
- **Real Image Upload Inference Endpoint**: Upload a dermoscopy image and receive a malignant/benign lesion risk prediction.
- **Probability-Based Classification**: Converts malignant probability into benign/malignant prediction labels using the backend prediction flow.

---

### Prediction Logic
The API performs inference using a **two-model ensemble** (ConvNeXt Small + EVA-02 Small):

- Each model processes the uploaded dermoscopy image independently.
- Both models output a probability score for the **malignant** class (after softmax).
- The final probability is the **average** of the two model outputs.
- Classification rule:
  - Probability **< 0.5** → classified as **benign**
  - Probability **≥ 0.5** → classified as **malignant**

This ensemble approach provides a good balance between accuracy and inference speed while keeping the deployment lightweight.

### Production Backend

- **FastAPI with Clean Architecture**: Layered structure using API routes, services, repositories, schemas, models, inference, RAG, and core configuration.
- **Async Image Processing**: Handles image uploads with validation before inference.
- **Pydantic v2 Schemas**: Strong type validation and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **Structured Logging**: Application logging using structlog JSON rendering.
- **Application Lifespan Hooks**: Logs startup and shutdown events through FastAPI lifespan management.
- **CORS Middleware**: Enables cross-origin usage for web clients, demos, and frontend integration.
- **Image Upload Validation**: Rejects non-image uploads with a meaningful `400` response.
- **Typed Prediction Response**: Returns `isic_id`, probability, prediction, model version, and timestamp.
- **Config Caching**: Uses `@lru_cache()` for efficient settings loading.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` with fields such as `APP_NAME`, `API_VERSION`, `MODEL_VERSION`, `DEBUG`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `SECRET_KEY`.

---

### Intelligent RAG Assistant

- **Project-Aware Retrieval Assistant**: Retrieves relevant project source-code context for technical Q&A.
- **Vector Search**: Uses FAISS with Sentence Transformers embeddings.
- **Codebase Indexing**: Indexes Python files from `src/**/*.py` plus a short project summary.
- **Chat Endpoint**: `/api/v1/chat` accepts a question and returns retrieved project context.

---

### Production & Observability

- **SQLite-Ready Persistence Layer**: SQLAlchemy model and repository structure are prepared for future prediction history storage.
- **Repository Pattern**: Encapsulates future database write logic in `PredictionRepository`.
- **Error Handling**: Includes validation and meaningful API errors for unsupported uploads and service-level failures.
- **Health Check Support**: Health endpoint is available for deployment checks and uptime monitoring.
- **Docker Support**: Fully containerized for cloud deployment.
- **Google Cloud Run Deployment**: Deployed with Docker on Google Cloud Run.
- **Google Cloud Build Source Deployment**: Uses `gcloud run deploy --source .` deployment workflow.
- **Warm Instance Setup**: Cloud Run configured with `--min-instances 1` for live demo readiness and reduced cold-start impact.
- **JSON Structured Logs**: structlog is configured with JSON rendering for production log aggregation.
- **Startup/Shutdown Logging**: Application lifecycle events are recorded for easier debugging.

---

### Developer Experience

- **Modular Codebase**: Separated API, service, inference, RAG, schema, config, and repository layers.
- **Notebook-to-Production Workflow**: Refactored setup, inference, backend, RAG, ensemble, and deployment work from notebooks into a deployable project.
- **Deployment Ready**: Containerized for Docker and Google Cloud Run.
